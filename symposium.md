<!-- Hi Welcome to the 2020 Conservation thing! -->
Welcome to the 2020 Bay Area Conservation Biology Symposium, hosted by the Stanford Chapter of the Society for Conservation Biology!  

<!-- ******************************************* -->

Where: **Stanford University**

When: **Saturday May 9, 2020**



The Bay Area Conservation Biology Symposium brings together conservation scientists, practitioners, and supporters from across the Bay Area to share pioneering research, forge new partnerships, and strengthen the local conservation community. 

For the first time, we're hosting a session with Stanford's Program for Conservation Genomics (PCG) as part of the symposium. This session will be devoted to creating a sense of community among Bay Area conservationists working with genomic tools, and to aide in developing collaborations. You can express interest in the PCG session on the abstract form below.

**Abstracts:** We are now accepting abstracts for posters, lightning talks, and full-length presentations as well as ideas for workshop and panel topics! If you are submitting an abstract or just want to express interest in attending, please fill out [this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSffHj1H2Z3bzZOaIWIOtA-mlXshEKVeagZe1nD6BZGhPZCPaw/viewform "Abstract Form"). Abstracts are due by April 3rd. 

**Registration** fees will be as follows: $10 for undergraduates, $15 for graduate students, $20 for postdocs, and $25 for faculty and professionals.  If the cost is prohibitive, please contact us (mviteri@stanford.edu or sredondo@stanford.edu). We want this to be an accessible event for all! Keep an eye out for our registration email which will come out in the next few weeks.
